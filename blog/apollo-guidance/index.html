<em>Mission Control Image: NASA</em></p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>The apollo guidance computer was one of the computers used for the duration of
the mission. This computer was mounted to the spacecraft, it aided the
astronauts in piloting and operating the spacecraft to the Moon's surface and
back. Its purpose at the start of the program varied during development but its
ultimate goal was to aid operation of the spacecraft and to return the
spacecraft to earth safely. The rest of the spacecraft such as its position and
navigation was calculated entirely on the ground computers and sent via radio.</p>
<p>Among the computers on the ground in the control center there were 3 computers
in the spacecraft. The command module had a computer running software that
handled communication to ground, navigation to, and navigation from the moon.
The lunar module had an identical computer running different software that was
designed to land the module and return it to the command module in orbit. This
module also had an abort computer that could backup the main computer in
returning to the command module in case of a problem because the lunar module
was not capable of being controlled from the ground.</p>
<h3 id="memory">Memory</h3>
<p>All of these operations were done with only 36K <em>words</em> of read-only memory and
2K thousand words of read-write memory. Each word was only 6 bits so the total
memory corresponds to about 27K bytes of read-only memory and 1.5K bytes of
read-write memory. The amount that was done on only that much memory is
impressive. Even more impressive is how far we have come. The high end of
computers today can run up to 2 <em>trillion</em> bytes of RAM off of a single
processor as well as nigh-infinite non-volatile storage. Not that modern
concepts of RAM and storage even compare to what was used in the spacecraft. The
AGC used core rope memory. In read-write memory each core can be magnetized in
a particular direction to represent a bit state. In the read-only memory the
data was <em>physically</em> built during construction of the memory.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>
<p>Interfacing with the onboard computers was done through an aptly named <em>Display
and Keyboard</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/p54.jpg" alt="DSKY" /></p>
<p><em>The Display and Keyboard (from Wichita State University Media Services)</em></p>
<p>This display certainly deviates from modern sensibilities of intuitive user
interface design and user experiences. Reference documentation is required to
even understand what everything on here does. This is what the 10 warning lights
on the left of the display are for (from <em>Computers On Board The Apollo
Spacecraft</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>COMP ACTY: This lit up when the computer was turning a program.</li>
<li>UPLINK ACTY: Lit when data was being received from the ground.</li>
<li>TEMP: Lit when the temperature of the stable platform was out of tolerance.</li>
<li>NO ATT: Lit when the inertial subsystem could not provide attitude
reference.</li>
<li>GIMBAL LOCK: Lit when the middle gimbal angle was greater than 70 degrees.</li>
<li>STBY: Lit when the computer system was on standby.</li>
<li>PROG: Lit when the computer was waiting for additional information to be
entered by the crew to complete the program.</li>
<li>KEY REL: Lit when the computer needed control of the DSKY to complete a
program. Sometimes display information could be &quot;buried&quot; under other
routines or by a priority interrupt. The crew could press the KEY REL key to
release the keyboard to the requesting program150. When the KEY REL light
went on, that signaled the crew to press the key.</li>
<li>RESTART: Lit when the computer was in the restart program. This was the
light that kept coming on during the Apollo11 landing.</li>
<li>OPR ERR: Lit when the computer detected an error on the keyboard.</li>
<li>TRACKER: Lit when one of the optical coupling units failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The digital displays on the display and keyboard are related to information
about what the computer is currently running and the current input for
controlling the computer. The input scheme follows suit with the physical design
of the display and keyboard itself in its lack of intuitive design. According to
astronaut feedback the system is very natural to use... after hours in
simulators. The computer uses a verb-noun pair for input where the verb and noun
are encoded to numbers. For example an input could be verb &quot;change&quot; and noun
&quot;program&quot; for changing the program currently running.</p>
<p>This system actually has modern counterparts in the form of Microsoft's
PowerShell command line shell. Its programs follow the same pattern as a naming
convention, albeit not numerically encoded. For example some built in commands
include <code>Get-Item</code> for getting information about an item on the filesystem or
<code>Remove-Item</code> for removing that item. It really is amazing how so much could be
done through a computer with such a relatively small amount of memory, 19
buttons, and 5 digital displays.</p>
<h3 id="cooling">Cooling</h3>
<p>Most terrestrial computers rely on some form of active convection to draw heat
away from the electrical components that produce it. This is usually done via
an array of aluminum or copper fins with air drawn through and away. There are
many different methods of transporting the heat to these fins whether it be
heat pipes, water pumped through tubes, or refrigerant run through a compressor.
However this all relies on the presence of cool air. Beyond the atmosphere of
earth there tends to be a lack of that particular resource but there are still
many heat producing components and computers on spacecraft. So how is
temperature regulated without air?</p>
<p>For the lunar missions NASA used a liquid coolant loop that draws heat from all
heat-producing components in the module. The coolant is a mix of ethylene-glycol
(anti-freeze) and water. This coolant is then pumped to the <em>sublimators</em>. These
are what pushes that heat from the module into space. This is cleverly done by
pushing water through porous plates where, due to the drop in pressure from the
vacuum of space, the water freezes into ice. The hot coolant is then pumped
through passages in the plates where the heat is absorbed by the ice which
promptly sublimates into steam, absorbing heat energy as it changes phases.</p>
